# A Profile in Well-Intentioned Failure...

## I am unprepared today.
I think the flu-ike symptoms that emerged Thursday eve were, in part, a function of stress, which was, in part a function of my ill-advised approach to this project, manifested across the following missteps:

1. Excess ambition

> The conceptual and mapping process took on a life of its own and I ended up with a concept that was perhaps too complicated for my knowledge/skill level and the alloted time. [Niche forum for people underwhelmed by today's musical trends]

2. Too much time researching and reviewing to fill in the gaps.

3. Too much time testing the functions on dummy content, before I had the basic site up.

> E.g., I got links/forms/posts/etc. to work in this mess: (http://localhost:3000/bumpin)

4. Decision to forgo bootstrap/skeleton and build site from scratch, with limited css/html skill.

5. Not enough time to pull it all off, especially given time wasted being ill.
